long-description:  This bipartite network denotes which languages are spoken in which countries.  Nodes are countries and languages; edge weights denote the proportion (between zero and one) of the population of a given country speaking a given language.  To quote the Unicode data description:  \"The main goal is to provide approximate figures for the literate, functional population for each language in each territory: that is, the population that is able to read and write each language, and is comfortable enough to use it with computers.\"

===========================================================================

This directory contains the TSV and related files of the unicodelang network: This bipartite network denotes which languages are spoken in which countries.  Nodes are countries and languages; edge weights denote the proportion (between zero and one) of the population of a given country speaking a given language.  To quote the Unicode data description:  \"The main goal is to provide approximate figures for the literate, functional population for each language in each territory: that is, the population that is able to read and write each language, and is comfortable enough to use it with computers.\"


More information about the network is provided here:

Files: 
    meta.unicodelang -- Metadata about the network 
    out.unicodelang -- The adjacency matrix of the network in whitespace-separated values format, with one edge per line
      The meaning of the columns in out.unicodelang are: 
        First column: ID of from node 
        Second column: ID of to node
        Third column (if present): weight or multiplicity of edge
        Fourth column (if present):  timestamp of edges Unix time
        Third column: edge weight
    ent.unicodelang.language.code -- Contains the attribute `code` of entity `language` of the network
    ent.unicodelang.coutry.code -- Contains the attribute `code` of entity `coutry` of the network
